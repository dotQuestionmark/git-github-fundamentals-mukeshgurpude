// Let's with the basics of CPP

// Import a library 😁

#include <iostream>   // It's precompiled code, which includes keywords, namespaces

using namespace std;

// Main function, it's better to write void as an argument
// It makes program more readable
int main(void){

  // Print statement, outputs to the console
  cout<<"Let's go with g++!!";
  // return 0;   // Tells the os, that the program execution was succesfull
}

// g++ {programFileName}.cpp -o {outputFileName}.(out | exe)
// Run the file
//  ./{outputFile}        - Powershell / bash
//  call {outputFile}     - On CMD
